# Authorship and Publications

## Authorship Guidelines

We follow the [ICMJE Definition of authorship](http://www.icmje.org/recommendations/browse/roles-and-responsibilities/defining-the-role-of-authors-and-contributors.html). To qualify for authorship, individuals must meet all four criteria:

1. Substantial contributions to conception/design, or acquisition/analysis/interpretation of data
2. Drafting the work or revising it critically for important intellectual content
3. Final approval of the version to be published
4. Agreement to be accountable for all aspects of the work

**Authorship practices:**

- **First authorship**: Typically goes to the person who led the work
- **Corresponding author**: Usually the PI, unless otherwise agreed
- **Co-authorship**: Determined by substantial intellectual contributions
- **Author order**: Should be discussed and agreed upon by all authors
- **Acknowledgments**: For contributions that don't meet authorship criteria

Authorship should be discussed early in a project and revisited as the work evolves. We encourage using the [CRediT Taxonomy](https://credit.niso.org/) to document specific author contributions.

## Publication Process

1. **Planning**: Discuss target journals, outline, and timeline with PIs
2. **Drafting**: Lead author prepares initial draft
3. **Internal review**: Co-authors review and provide feedback
4. **Revision**: Lead author incorporates feedback iteratively
5. **PI approval**: Obtain final approval from PIs before submission
6. **Submission**: Submit to journal
7. **Revisions**: Lead author coordinates response to peer reviewers
8. **Publication**: Celebrate and share!

## Preprints and Open Access

- We encourage posting preprints prior to or during peer review on platforms like [medRxiv](https://www.medrxiv.org/) or [bioRxiv](https://www.biorxiv.org/)
- Preprints allow rapid dissemination of findings and can be cited in grant applications
- We support publishing in open access journals when possible to maximize accessibility
- Many funders, including NIH, have public access policies that require making publications freely available

## Reporting Checklists

Using reporting checklists ensures that publications contain information needed for readers to assess validity and reproducibility. We use checklists appropriate to study design:

- CONSORT for randomized trials
- STROBE for observational studies
- PRISMA for systematic reviews
- Others as appropriate (see [EQUATOR Network](https://www.equator-network.org/))

## Publishing Data and Code

- We publish data on platforms like [Open Science Framework](https://osf.io) when ethically and legally permissible
- We share analysis code via GitHub repositories
- We archive code on [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org) for long-term preservation with DOI
- Include data dictionaries and README files with published datasets
- Follow funder and journal requirements for data sharing

## Manuscript Checklist

Before submitting a manuscript:

- [ ] Completed relevant reporting checklist
- [ ] Results are reproducible (rerunning code replicates tables/figures exactly)
- [ ] Target journal selected
- [ ] Title is declarative and states findings clearly
- [ ] Word count meets journal requirements
- [ ] Manuscript follows journal formatting guidelines
- [ ] Consistent voice throughout (typically active voice)
- [ ] All figures and tables referenced in main text
- [ ] Captions for all figures and tables
- [ ] Tables/figures numbered by order of appearance
- [ ] Abbreviations defined at first use and used sparingly
- [ ] Avoid subjective wording (e.g., "interesting", "dramatic")
- [ ] Avoid directionless statements (specify direction of associations)
- [ ] Causal language only when supported by study design
- [ ] Avoid "significant" (easily confused with statistical significance)
- [ ] Author contributions drafted using CRediT Taxonomy
