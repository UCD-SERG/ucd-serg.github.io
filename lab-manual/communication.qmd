# Communication and Coordination

Effective communication is essential for successful collaboration. We use several platforms for different types of communication.

## Microsoft Teams

- Use Microsoft Teams for scheduling, coding-related questions, quick check-ins, and day-to-day coordination
- If your message exceeds 200 words, consider using email instead
- Use channels instead of direct messages unless discussing something private
- Please respond to messages that tag you (e.g., `@yourname`) as quickly as possible and always within 24 hours
- If you are unusually busy or on vacation, alert the team in advance and set your status so we know not to expect immediate responses
- Thread messages as much as possible to keep conversations organized
- Respect people's off-hours by using scheduled messages when appropriate

## Email

- Use email for longer messages (>200 words) or messages that merit preservation
- Generally, strive to respond within 24 hours during business hours
- As noted above, if you are unusually busy or on vacation, alert the team in advance

## Project Management Tools

- We use project management tools (e.g., Trello, GitHub Projects) to track tasks and progress
- Higher priority tasks are listed at the top of your list
- Strive to complete tasks by the dates listed
- Use checklists to break down tasks into smaller, manageable chunks
- Update task status regularly to keep the team informed

## Lab Meetings

We hold regular lab meetings to discuss ongoing research, practice presentations, and discuss relevant literature. All lab members are expected to attend unless they have a conflict.

- **Timing**: Meetings start on time. If you will be late, send a message to the group
- **Frequency**: Weekly (schedule may vary by quarter)
- **Format**: Varies - research updates, journal clubs, practice talks, methods discussions
- **Preparation**: Come prepared to participate and provide constructive feedback
- If you are regularly unable to attend at the scheduled time, notify the team so we can consider adjusting the schedule

## Individual Meetings

Graduate students and postdocs should meet with their PI(s) regularly:

- **Frequency**: At least bi-weekly, more often as needed
- **Preparation**: Send an agenda at least 24 hours in advance
- **Follow-up**: Send notes summarizing action items and decisions

## Email and Messaging

- Check email regularly during working hours
- Respond to emails from PIs and collaborators within 24-48 hours
- Use subject lines that clearly indicate the topic
- For urgent matters, follow up with a message or call
- We do not expect responses outside of business hours
