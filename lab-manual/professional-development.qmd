# Mentorship and Professional Development

## Mentoring Philosophy

We believe in individualized mentoring that supports each person's unique career goals. Effective mentoring requires:

- Regular, open communication between mentees and mentors
- Mutual respect and trust
- Clear expectations and goals
- Constructive feedback
- Support for both research and career development

## Individual Development Plans

All graduate students and postdocs should maintain an Individual Development Plan (IDP) that outlines:

- Short-term and long-term career goals
- Skills to develop
- Training needs and opportunities
- Timeline and milestones
- Progress toward goals

Update your IDP at least annually and discuss it with your PI. Useful resources:

- [myIDP - Individual Development Plan tool](https://myidp.sciencecareers.org/)
- [NIH OITE Career Resources](https://www.training.nih.gov/career_resources)

## Presentations and Conferences

We encourage lab members to present their work at conferences and seminars:

- Discuss conference opportunities with PIs early
- Submit abstracts with PI approval
- Practice presentations in lab meeting before the conference
- Funding for conferences depends on availability and should be discussed in advance

**Resources for effective presentations:**

- [How to tell a compelling story in scientific presentations](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-03603-2)
- [How to make a better poster](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RwJbhkCA58)

## Scientific Figures

Creating clear, effective figures is essential for communicating research findings:

- Label x-axis and y-axis clearly
- Use panel labels when including multiple subplots
- Include sufficient tick marks and labels
- Use appropriate font sizes (readable but not distracting)
- Use colorblind-friendly palettes (see [ColorBrewer](http://colorbrewer2.org/) or [iwanthue](https://medialab.github.io/iwanthue/))
- Define colors, shapes, and line types in legends
- Minimize abbreviations in labels and legends
- Use transparency to show overlapping data
- Show measures of precision (e.g., 95% confidence intervals)

## Grant Writing

- Graduate students and postdocs are encouraged to apply for fellowships (e.g., NIH F31, NSF GRFP, K awards)
- PIs will support fellowship applications with feedback, letters of support, and mentoring
- Start planning fellowship applications well in advance of deadlines (typically 3-6 months)
- Attend grant writing workshops and seek feedback from multiple sources

## Teaching and Outreach

Teaching and outreach are valuable professional development opportunities:

- Graduate students are encouraged to gain teaching experience
- We support science communication and outreach activities
- Discuss opportunities with PIs

## Networking

Building a professional network is important for your career:

- Attend seminars and departmental events
- Connect with researchers in your field
- Join professional societies
- Use social media professionally (e.g., Twitter/X for science)
