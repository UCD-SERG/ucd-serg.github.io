# GitHub

*Adapted from the [Benjamin-Chung Lab Manual](https://jadebc.github.io/lab-manual/)*

## Basics

- A detailed tutorial of Git can be found [here on the CS61B website](https://sp19.datastructur.es/materials/guides/using-git#b-local-repositories-narrative-introduction)
- If you are already familiar with Git, reference the summary at [Section B](https://sp19.datastructur.es/materials/guides/using-git#b-local-repositories-narrative-introduction)
- If you made a mistake, refer to [this article](https://sethrobertson.github.io/GitFixUm/fixup.html) to undo, fix, or remove commits

## GitHub Desktop

While the command line provides full power and flexibility, GitHub also provides [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) as a graphical interface for basic git commands. This is a good alternative if you prefer a visual interface.

## Git Branching

Branches allow you to keep track of multiple versions of your work simultaneously. Use branches when:

* You want to make dramatic changes (refactoring) without breaking code for collaborators
* You want to start working on a new feature that may not make it to the final product
* You are working with others and don't want to mix up your current work with theirs

## Example Workflow

A standard workflow for contributing code:

| Step | Command   | Description      |
|------|-----------|------------------|
| SETUP | `git clone <url> <directory_name>` | Clone the repo (first time only) |
| 1 | `git pull origin main` | Update to match most current version on GitHub |
| 2 | `git checkout -b <new_branch_name>` | Create new branch and switch to it |
| 3 | Make file changes | Work on your feature/implementation |
| 4 | `git add -p` | Add changes to stage, reviewing line by line |
| 5 | `git commit -m <commit message>` | Commit files with a descriptive message |
| 6 | `git push -u origin <branch_name>` | Push branch to remote (first push) |
| 7 | Repeat 4-5 | Work and commit often |
| 8 | `git push` | Push work to remote branch |
| 9 | Submit pull request on GitHub | Merge work from branch into main |
| 10 | PR approved and merged | Reviewer deletes remote branch upon merging |
| 11 | `git fetch --all --prune` | Clean up local git, untrack deleted remote branches |

**Note**: Many repositories now use `main` as the default branch instead of `master`. Check your repository's default branch name.

## Commonly Used Git Commands

| Command   | Description      |
|-----------|------------------|
| `git clone <url> <directory_name>` | Clone a repository (first time only) |
| `git pull origin main` | Pull from `main` before making changes |
| `git branch` | Check what branch you are on |
| `git branch -a` | Check local branch + all remote branches |
| `git checkout -b <new_branch_name>` | Create new branch and switch to it |
| `git checkout <branch_name>` | Switch to existing branch |
| `git add <file_name>` | Add file to stage for commit |
| `git add -p` | Add changes interactively, showing one by one |
| `git commit -m <message>` | Commit with a message |
| `git push -u origin <branch_name>` | Push and set upstream (first push) |
| `git push origin <branch_name>` | Push to branch |
| `git checkout --track origin/<branch_name>` | Pull remote branch and create local branch |
| `git branch -d <branch_name>` | Delete local branch (-D to force) |
| `git fetch --all --prune` | Untrack deleted remote branches |

**Note**: Commands above use `main` as the default branch. Some repositories may still use `master` - check your repository's default branch name.

## Best Practices

### Commit Frequency
Commit every 15 minutes or every time you make a significant change. It is better to commit more rather than less.

### What Should Be Pushed to GitHub?

**Never push:**
- `.Rout` files - difficult to reconcile when multiple people push
- Temporary files, log files
- Large data files (use shared directory or data repository instead)
- Sensitive data or credentials

**Use `.gitignore`:**
- Download a [standardized `.gitignore` for R](https://github.com/github/gitignore/blob/master/R.gitignore)
- Download a [standardized `.gitignore` for Python](https://github.com/github/gitignore/blob/master/Python.gitignore)
- This ensures you don't commit log files or temporary files

### Project-Oriented Workflows

Create self-contained, portable projects. See [this discussion](https://www.tidyverse.org/articles/2017/12/workflow-vs-script/) on project-oriented workflows.
