# Coding Practices

## Code and Software

- Write clear, well-commented code that others can understand
- Use version control (Git/GitHub) for all code
- Follow coding style guidelines:
  - For R: [Hadley Wickham's Style Guide](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Style.html) or tidyverse style guide
  - For Python: PEP 8 style guide
- Create reproducible workflows that allow results to be regenerated with a single command (e.g., a master script)
- Document software dependencies and versions (e.g., using `renv` for R, `requirements.txt` for Python)
- Share code openly when publishing (e.g., via GitHub)
- Archive code on platforms like Zenodo for long-term preservation
- Include README files that explain how to run the code
- Remove commented-out code and debug statements before finalizing scripts

## Code Checklist

Before sharing or finalizing code:

- Does the script run without errors?
- Is code self-contained within the repository?
- Is all commented-out code / debug remarks removed?
- Does the header accurately describe what the script does?
- Is the script pushed to its GitHub repository?
- Does the code adhere to the coding style guide?
- Are all warnings either addressed or documented as ignorable?

## GitHub and Version Control

Version control is essential for reproducible research. All lab members should:

- Use Git and GitHub for tracking code changes
- Commit changes regularly with informative commit messages
- Use branches for developing new features or analyses
- Write clear README files for each repository
- Include licenses for code repositories (typically MIT or GPL for open source)
- Link GitHub repositories in publications

## Literature and Resources

- Stay current with relevant literature in your field
- Maintain a reference management system (e.g., Zotero, Mendeley)
- Share interesting papers with the lab
- Contribute to lab knowledge base
