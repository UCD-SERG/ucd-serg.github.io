We are always seeking motivated individuals to join our research group. Below are opportunities for undergraduate students, graduate students, and postdoctoral research fellows.

## Undergraduate Students

We welcome undergraduate students interested in gaining research experience in seroepidemiology and infectious disease modeling. Undergraduate researchers in our group work on data analysis, literature reviews, and contribute to ongoing research projects.

**Note:** All undergraduate research opportunities are unfunded volunteer positions, though students may earn academic credit through departmental research units.

### Recommended Skills

- **Programming**: Experience with R or Python. 
- **Coursework**: Coursework in statistics, biostatistics, and epidemiology is helpful.
- **Biology/Public Health**: Interest in infectious diseases, immunology, or public health.
- **Data Analysis**: Experience working with and anlyzing data. 
- **Communication**: Strong written and verbal communication skills.

### How to Apply

If you are interested in joining our group as an undergraduate researcher, please send an email to [ucdserg@ucdavis.edu](mailto:ucdserg@ucdavis.edu) with:

- A brief statement of interest (1 paragraph)
- Your CV or resume
- Unofficial transcript
- Any relevant coursework or experience

## Graduate Students

We are looking for motivated graduate students to join our group through the UC Davis [Graduate Group in Epidemiology](https://www.epi.ucdavis.edu/) or related programs. Graduate students in our group work on developing and applying seroepidemiologic methods to estimate disease burden in populations.

**Funding:** Most graduate student positions are unfunded, though competitive students may receive 1-2 years of internal funding through Graduate Studies. Graduate students are expected to apply for external fellowships throughout their studies, particularly NIH F-31 predoctoral fellowships.

### Recommended Skills

- **Quantitative Background**: Strong foundation in statistics, mathematics, epidemiology, modeling or related quantitative fields.
- **Programming**: Proficiency in R or Python for statistical analysis and data visualization.
- **Infectious Diseases**: Interest in infectious disease dynamics and serology.
- **Collaboration**: Ability to work effectively in interdisciplinary teams.
- **Communication**: Strong written and verbal communication skills.


### How to Apply

Prospective graduate students should:

1. Review the [UC Davis Graduate Group in Epidemiology admissions requirements](https://www.epi.ucdavis.edu/admissions)
2. Apply through the official graduate admissions portal
3. Indicate interest in working with Drs. Kristen Aiemjoy and/or Ezra Morrison in your application
4. Feel free to reach out to us at [ucdserg@ucdavis.edu](mailto:ucdserg@ucdavis.edu) before applying
