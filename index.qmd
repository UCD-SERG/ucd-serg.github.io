Accurate methods to measure infectious disease burden are essential for guiding public health decisions, 
yet many infectious diseases remain under-recognized due to limited diagnostics and costly, resource-intensive surveillance systems. 
Our work addresses this gap by developing seroepidemiologic methods to characterize infection burden in populations. 
Currently, we focus on enteric fever (*Salmonella Typhi and Paratyphi*), Scrub Typhus (*Orientia tsutsugamushi*), Melioidosis (*Burkholderia pseudomallei*), Shigella (*Shigella spp.*), and Cholera (*Vibrio cholerae*). 


 Our research group is based at the University of California, Davis, and is led by Drs. Kristen Aiemjoy and Ezra Morrison and supported by US National Institutes of Health and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. 
 
 We are always looking for new collaborators and students. If you are interested in working with us, please check out our opportunities page [here](opportunities.qmd) or reach out to us at [ucdserg@ucdavis.edu](mailto:ucdserg@ucdavis.edu),
