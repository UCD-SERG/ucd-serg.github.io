    "text": "Welcome to the UC Davis Seroepidemiology Research Group (UCD-SeRG), led by Drs. Kristen Aiemjoy and Ezra Morrison. Our mission is to improve population health by developing and applying seroepidemiologic methods to characterize infectious disease burden in populations. We focus on diseases that are under-recognized due to limited diagnostics and resource-intensive surveillance systems, including enteric fever (Salmonella Typhi and Paratyphi), Scrub Typhus (Orientia tsutsugamushi), Melioidosis (Burkholderia pseudomallei), Shigella (Shigella spp.), and Cholera (Vibrio cholerae).\nOur research group is based at the University of California, Davis, and we collaborate with partners around the world, including in South Asia, Southeast Asia, Sub-Saharan Africa, and Latin America. We use a variety of epidemiologic, computational, and statistical methods, including causal inference and machine learning methods, in pursuit of our mission.\n\n\n\nThis lab manual covers our communication strategy, code of conduct, and best practices for reproducibility of computational workflows. It is a living document that is updated regularly to reflect our evolving practices and lessons learned.\nThis manual was created with inspiration from other scientists’ lab manuals, particularly the Benjamin-Chung Lab Manual.\nFeel free to draw from this manual and adapt it for your own use.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe develop and apply seroepidemiologic methods to characterize infectious disease burden in populations, with a focus on diseases that are under-recognized due to limited diagnostics and resource-intensive surveillance. Our work aims to provide accurate methods to measure infectious disease burden to guide public health decisions.\n\n\n\n\nScientific rigor and reproducibility: We are committed to conducting high-quality, reproducible research that advances the field\nOpen science: We share our methods, code, and data openly whenever possible to enable others to build upon our work\nCollaboration: We work with partners around the world and value diverse perspectives and interdisciplinary approaches\nMentorship: We support the professional development of all lab members at every career stage\nDiversity, equity, and inclusion: We strive to create a welcoming, anti-racist environment where people of all backgrounds are equally and inclusively supported\nWork-life balance: We recognize that doing great science requires taking care of ourselves and maintaining sustainable work practices\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe are committed to a lab culture that is collaborative, supportive, inclusive, open, and free from discrimination and harassment.\nWe encourage lab members of all experience levels to respectfully share their honest opinions and ideas on any topic. Our group thrives upon such respectful input from team members, and open dialogue helps us continuously improve our productivity and the quality of our work.\n\n\n\nThe UCD-SeRG lab recognizes the importance of and is committed to cultivating a culture of diversity, equity, and inclusion. This means being a safe, supportive, and anti-racist environment in which students from diverse backgrounds are equally and inclusively supported in their education and training. Diversity takes many forms, including, but not limited to, differences in race, ethnicity, gender, sexuality, socioeconomic status, religion, disability, and political affiliation.\n\n\n\nAll lab members are expected to:\n\nConduct research with integrity and honesty\nTreat all lab members, collaborators, and research participants with respect\nCommunicate openly and regularly with the PIs and other lab members\nContribute to a positive, collaborative lab environment\nTake responsibility for your own professional development\nParticipate in lab meetings and group activities\nMaintain good documentation of your work\nFollow all institutional policies and research ethics guidelines\n\n\n\n\nWe recognize that people have different working styles and personal obligations. One benefit of the academic environment is its schedule flexibility. Graduate students and postdocs are expected to work full-time hours, but we offer flexibility in when and where you work. Undergraduate researchers typically commit 10-15 hours per week.\nLab members may choose to work in the early morning, evening, or weekends. However, we do not expect lab members to respond to communications outside of business hours unless there are special circumstances.\nWhat matters most is that you:\n\nMake consistent progress on your research\nMeet deadlines and commitments\nAre available for scheduled meetings and lab events\nCommunicate your schedule and availability\n\n\n\n\nTaking time off is important for maintaining productivity and well-being. Lab members should:\n\nCoordinate time off with the PIs in advance\nAlert the team if you will be unusually busy (e.g., taking exams, major deadlines) or on vacation so we know not to expect immediate responses\nEnsure ongoing projects are covered during your absence\nUpdate the lab calendar with your planned absences\nFollow university policies for holidays and leave\n\n\n\n\nAll lab members must complete required human subjects research training (e.g., CITI training) and share their certificate with the PIs. Team members will be added to relevant Institutional Review Board (IRB) protocols prior to working with identifiable datasets.\nOne of the most relevant aspects of protecting human subjects in our work is maintaining confidentiality. In practice, this means:\n\nUnderstand and comply with project-specific policies about where data can be saved, particularly if the data include personal identifiers\nDo not share data with anyone without permission, including other members of the group who might not be on the same IRB protocol (check with PIs first)\nRemember that data that appears non-identifiable may still require special protection under IRB or HIPAA regulations\nAlways proceed with caution and ask for help if you have concerns about maintaining study participant confidentiality\n\n\n\n\nWe adhere to the ICMJE Definition of authorship and are happy for team members who meet the definition of authorship to be included as co-authors on scientific manuscripts.\nAuthorship should be discussed early in a project and revisited as the work evolves to ensure transparency and fairness.\n\n\n\n\nEffective communication is essential for successful collaboration. We use several platforms for different types of communication.\n\n\n\nUse Slack for scheduling, coding-related questions, quick check-ins, and day-to-day coordination\nIf your message exceeds 200 words, consider using email instead\nUse channels instead of direct messages unless discussing something private\nPlease respond to messages that tag you (e.g., @yourname) as quickly as possible and always within 24 hours\nIf you are unusually busy or on vacation, alert the team in advance and set your status so we know not to expect immediate responses\nThread messages as much as possible to keep conversations organized\nRespect people’s off-hours by using scheduled messages when appropriate\n\n\n\n\n\nUse email for longer messages (&gt;200 words) or messages that merit preservation\nGenerally, strive to respond within 24 hours during business hours\nAs noted above, if you are unusually busy or on vacation, alert the team in advance\n\n\n\n\n\nWe use project management tools (e.g., Trello, GitHub Projects) to track tasks and progress\nHigher priority tasks are listed at the top of your list\nStrive to complete tasks by the dates listed\nUse checklists to break down tasks into smaller, manageable chunks\nUpdate task status regularly to keep the team informed\n\n\n\n\nWe hold regular lab meetings to discuss ongoing research, practice presentations, and discuss relevant literature. All lab members are expected to attend unless they have a conflict.\n\nTiming: Meetings start on time. If you will be late, send a message to the group\nFrequency: Weekly (schedule may vary by quarter)\nFormat: Varies - research updates, journal clubs, practice talks, methods discussions\nPreparation: Come prepared to participate and provide constructive feedback\nIf you are regularly unable to attend at the scheduled time, notify the team so we can consider adjusting the schedule\n\n\n\n\nGraduate students and postdocs should meet with their PI(s) regularly:\n\nFrequency: At least bi-weekly, more often as needed\nPreparation: Send an agenda at least 24 hours in advance\nFollow-up: Send notes summarizing action items and decisions\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck email regularly during working hours\nRespond to emails from PIs and collaborators within 24-48 hours\nUse subject lines that clearly indicate the topic\nFor urgent matters, follow up with a message or call\nWe do not expect responses outside of business hours\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur lab adopts rigorous practices to maximize the reproducibility of our work:\n\nDesign studies with appropriate methodology and adherence to best practices in epidemiology and biostatistics\nRegister study protocols when appropriate\nWrite and register pre-analysis plans for confirmatory research\nCreate reproducible computational workflows\nProcess and analyze data with internal replication and masking when possible\nUse reporting checklists with manuscripts\nPublish preprints\nPublish data (when possible) and replication code\n\n\n\n\nIn the past decade, an increasing number of studies have found that published findings could not be reproduced, both computationally (with the same data and code) and scientifically (with newly collected data using similar study designs). This “reproducibility crisis” has occurred across disciplines and has motivated new practices in transparency and openness. Our lab is committed to adopting these best practices.\nRecommended readings:\n\nNuzzo R. How scientists fool themselves – and how they can stop.

All lab members should:\n\nUse Git and GitHub for tracking code changes\nCommit changes regularly with informative commit messages\nUse branches for developing new features or analyses\nWrite clear README files for each repository\nInclude licenses for code repositories (typically MIT or GPL for open source)\nLink GitHub repositories in publications\n\nResources:\n\nIntroduction to Git\nIntroduction to GitHub\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe follow the ICMJE Definition of authorship. To qualify for authorship, individuals must meet all four criteria:\n\nSubstantial contributions to conception/design, or acquisition/analysis/interpretation of data\nDrafting the work or revising it critically for important intellectual content\nFinal approval of the version to be published\nAgreement to be accountable for all aspects of the work\n\nAuthorship practices:\n\nFirst authorship: Typically goes to the person who led the work\nCorresponding author: Usually the PI, unless otherwise agreed\nCo-authorship: Determined by substantial intellectual contributions\nAuthor order: Should be discussed and agreed upon by all authors\nAcknowledgments: For contributions that don’t meet authorship criteria\n\nAuthorship should be discussed early in a project and revisited as the work evolves. We encourage using the CRediT Taxonomy to document specific author contributions.\n\n\n\n\nPlanning: Discuss target journals, outline, and timeline with PIs\nDrafting: Lead author prepares initial draft\nInternal review: Co-authors review and provide feedback\nRevision: Lead author incorporates feedback iteratively\nPI approval: Obtain final approval from PIs before submission\nSubmission: Submit to journal\nRevisions: Lead author coordinates response to peer reviewers\nPublication: Celebrate and share!\n\n\n\n\n\nWe encourage posting preprints prior to or during peer review on platforms like medRxiv or bioRxiv\nPreprints allow rapid dissemination of findings and can be cited in grant applications\nWe support publishing in open access journals when possible to maximize accessibility\nMany funders, including NIH, have public access policies that require making publications freely available\n\n\n\n\nUsing reporting checklists ensures that publications contain information needed for readers to assess validity and reproducibility. We use checklists appropriate to study design:\n\nCONSORT for randomized trials\nSTROBE for observational studies\nPRISMA for systematic reviews\nOthers as appropriate (see EQUATOR Network)\n\n\n\n\n\nWe publish data on platforms like Open Science Framework when ethically and legally permissible\nWe share analysis code via GitHub repositories\nWe archive code on Zenodo for long-term preservation with DOI\nInclude data dictionaries and README files with published datasets\nFollow funder and journal requirements for data sharing\n\n\n\n\nBefore submitting a manuscript:\n\nCompleted relevant reporting checklist\nResults are reproducible (rerunning code replicates tables/figures exactly)\nTarget journal selected\nTitle is declarative and states findings clearly\nWord count meets journal requirements\nManuscript follows journal formatting guidelines\nConsistent voice throughout (typically active voice)\nAll figures and tables referenced in main text\nCaptions for all figures and tables\nTables/figures numbered by order of appearance\nAbbreviations defined at first use and used sparingly\nAvoid subjective wording (e.g., “interesting”, “dramatic”)\nAvoid directionless statements (specify direction of associations)\nCausal language only when supported by study design\nAvoid “significant” (easily confused with statistical significance)\nAuthor contributions drafted using CRediT Taxonomy\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe believe in individualized mentoring that supports each person’s unique career goals. Effective mentoring requires:\n\nRegular, open communication between mentees and mentors\nMutual respect and trust\nClear expectations and goals\nConstructive feedback\nSupport for both research and career development\n\n\n\n\nAll graduate students and postdocs should maintain an Individual Development Plan (IDP) that outlines:\n\nShort-term and long-term career goals\nSkills to develop\nTraining needs and opportunities\nTimeline and milestones\nProgress toward goals\n\nUpdate your IDP at least annually and discuss it with your PI.

This “reproducibility crisis” has occurred across disciplines and has motivated new practices in transparency and openness. Our lab is committed to adopting these best practices.\nRecommended readings:\n\nNuzzo R. How scientists fool themselves – and how they can stop.

Our work addresses this gap by developing seroepidemiologic methods to characterize infection burden in populations. Currently, we focus on enteric fever (Salmonella Typhi and Paratyphi), Scrub Typhus (Orientia tsutsugamushi), Melioidosis (Burkholderia pseudomallei), Shigella (Shigella spp.), and Cholera (Vibrio cholerae).\nOur research group is based at the University of California, Davis, and is led by Drs.

The position is full-time, funded for two years, with opportunities to apply for competitive external fellowship funding should the fellow wish to pursue further independent support.\nThe postdoc will join a dynamic interdisciplinary environment focused on antibody kinetics, infectious disease modeling, and global health surveillance. This work will involve close collaboration with partners at Massachusetts General Hospital / Harvard Medical School and Sabin Vaccine Institute. International travel to study sites and partner meetings may be required. Position start date is flexible, ideally between January and March 2026. Ideally, the fellow will attend the Coalition Against Typhoid (CaT) meeting in Phnom Penh, Cambodia in March 2026."

The postdoctoral fellow will contribute to modeling post-infection antibody kinetics using longitudinal datasets from confirmed typhoid and iNTS cases; extending two-phase within-host models and seroincidence likelihood frameworks to settings with high co-circulation of Salmonella serovars; and assessing antigen specificity and potential cross-reactivity. The fellow will also contribute to R package development, to support reproducible workflows and methodological innovation within seroepidemiology. This work will inform global typhoid and iNTS burden estimation and strengthen serosurveillance approaches for use in countries where blood culture surveillance systems are limited. The fellow will receive structured mentorship from Drs. Aiemjoy and Morrison, including weekly one-on-one meetings and individualized professional development planning, and will lead at least 3 first-author manuscripts and contribute to several additional collaborative manuscripts."
