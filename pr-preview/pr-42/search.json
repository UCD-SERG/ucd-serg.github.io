    "text": "The UC Davis Seroepidemiology Research Group (SeRG) led by Dr. Kristen Aiemjoy and Dr. Ezra Morrison, is seeking a highly motivated Postdoctoral Research Fellow to contribute to a new Gates Foundation–funded project aimed at advancing global serosurveillance tools for Salmonella infections, including typhoidal Salmonella and invasive non-typhoidal Salmonella (iNTS). The position is full-time, funded for two years, with opportunities to apply for competitive external fellowship funding should the fellow wish to pursue further independent support.\nThe postdoc will join a dynamic interdisciplinary environment focused on antibody kinetics, infectious disease modeling, and global health surveillance. This work will involve close collaboration with partners at Massachusetts General Hospital / Harvard Medical School and Sabin Vaccine Institute. International travel to study sites and partner meetings may be required. Position start date is flexible, ideally between January and March 2026. Ideally, the fellow will attend the Coalition Against Typhoid (CaT) meeting in Phnom Penh, Cambodia in March 2026."

The postdoctoral fellow will contribute to modeling post-infection antibody kinetics using longitudinal datasets from confirmed typhoid and iNTS cases; extending two-phase within-host models and seroincidence likelihood frameworks to settings with high co-circulation of Salmonella serovars; and assessing antigen specificity and potential cross-reactivity. The fellow will also contribute to R package development, to support reproducible workflows and methodological innovation within seroepidemiology. This work will inform global typhoid and iNTS burden estimation and strengthen serosurveillance approaches for use in countries where blood culture surveillance systems are limited. The fellow will receive structured mentorship from Drs. Aiemjoy and Morrison, including weekly one-on-one meetings and individualized professional development planning, and will lead at least 3 first-author manuscripts and contribute to several additional collaborative manuscripts."

Team members will be added to relevant Institutional Review Board (IRB) protocols prior to working with identifiable datasets.\nOne of the most relevant aspects of protecting human subjects in our work is maintaining confidentiality. In practice, this means:\n\nUnderstand and comply with project-specific policies about where data can be saved, particularly if the data include personal identifiers\nDo not share data with anyone without permission, including other members of the group who might not be on the same IRB protocol (check with PIs first)\nRemember that data that appears non-identifiable may still require special protection under IRB or HIPAA regulations\nAlways proceed with caution and ask for help if you have concerns about maintaining study participant confidentiality\n\n\n\n\nWe adhere to the ICMJE Definition of authorship and are happy for team members who meet the definition of authorship to be included as co-authors on scientific manuscripts.\nAuthorship should be discussed early in a project and revisited as the work evolves to ensure transparency and fairness.",

Team members will be added to relevant Institutional Review Board (IRB) protocols prior to working with identifiable datasets.\nOne of the most relevant aspects of protecting human subjects in our work is maintaining confidentiality. In practice, this means:\n\nUnderstand and comply with project-specific policies about where data can be saved, particularly if the data include personal identifiers\nDo not share data with anyone without permission, including other members of the group who might not be on the same IRB protocol (check with PIs first)\nRemember that data that appears non-identifiable may still require special protection under IRB or HIPAA regulations\nAlways proceed with caution and ask for help if you have concerns about maintaining study participant confidentiality",
