Her current research focuses on advancing seroepidemiologic methods to characterize the population-level force of infection for enteric fever to support global vaccine uptake and enhanced disease surveillance. Kristina brings over a decade of experience as an epidemiologist in state and local health departments, clinical research organizations, international nonprofits, and public health consulting. In her free time, she enjoys chasing after her toddler and getting outdoors with her family."

    "text": "Accurate methods to measure infectious disease burden are essential for guiding public health decisions, yet many infectious diseases remain under-recognized due to limited diagnostics and costly, resource-intensive surveillance systems. Our work addresses this gap by developing seroepidemiologic methods to characterize infection burden in populations. Currently, we focus on enteric fever (Salmonella Typhi and Paratyphi), Scrub Typhus (Orientia tsutsugamushi), Melioidosis (Burkholderia pseudomallei), Shigella (Shigella spp.), and Cholera (Vibrio cholerae).\nOur research group is based at the University of California, Davis, and is led by Drs. Kristen Aiemjoy and Ezra Morrison and supported by US National Institutes of Health and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.\nWe are always looking for new collaborators and students.
