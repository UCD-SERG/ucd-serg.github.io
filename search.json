The position is full-time, funded for two years, with opportunities to apply for competitive external fellowship funding should the fellow wish to pursue further independent support.\nThe postdoc will join a dynamic interdisciplinary environment focused on antibody kinetics, infectious disease modeling, and global health surveillance. This work will involve close collaboration with partners at Massachusetts General Hospital / Harvard Medical School and Sabin Vaccine Institute. International travel to study sites and partner meetings may be required. Position start date is flexible, ideally between January and March 2025.

The postdoctoral fellow will contribute to modeling post-infection antibody kinetics using longitudinal datasets from confirmed typhoid and iNTS cases; extending two-phase within-host models and seroincidence likelihood frameworks to settings with high co-circulation of Salmonella serovars; and assessing antigen specificity and potential cross-reactivity. The fellow will also contribute to R package development, to support reproducible workflows and methodological innovation within seroepidemiology. This work will inform global typhoid and iNTS burden estimation and strengthen serosurveillance approaches for use in countries where blood culture surveillance systems are limited. The fellow will receive structured mentorship from Drs. Aiemjoy and Morrison, including weekly one-on-one meetings and individualized professional development planning, and will lead at least 3 first-author manuscripts and contribute to several additional collaborative manuscripts."
