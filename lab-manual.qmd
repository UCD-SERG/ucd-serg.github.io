Welcome to the UC Davis Seroepidemiology Research Group (UCD-SeRG) lab manual! This manual serves as a guide to our lab culture, expectations, and practices. It is a living document that will evolve as our group grows and changes.

## Mission and Values

### Our Mission

We develop and apply seroepidemiologic methods to characterize infectious disease burden in populations, with a focus on diseases that are under-recognized due to limited diagnostics and resource-intensive surveillance. Our work aims to provide accurate methods to measure infectious disease burden to guide public health decisions.

### Our Values

- **Scientific rigor**: We are committed to conducting high-quality, reproducible research
- **Open science**: We share our methods, code, and data openly whenever possible
- **Collaboration**: We work with partners around the world and value diverse perspectives
- **Mentorship**: We support the professional development of all lab members
- **Equity and inclusion**: We strive to create a welcoming environment for people of all backgrounds
- **Work-life balance**: We recognize that doing great science requires taking care of ourselves

## Lab Culture and Expectations

### General Expectations

All lab members are expected to:

- Conduct research with integrity and honesty
- Treat all lab members, collaborators, and research participants with respect
- Communicate openly and regularly with the PIs and other lab members
- Contribute to a positive, collaborative lab environment
- Take responsibility for your own professional development
- Participate in lab meetings and group activities
- Maintain good documentation of your work
- Follow all institutional policies and research ethics guidelines

### Work Hours and Flexibility

We recognize that people have different working styles and personal obligations. Graduate students and postdocs are expected to work full-time hours, but we offer flexibility in when and where you work. Undergraduate researchers typically commit 10-15 hours per week.

What matters most is that you:

- Make consistent progress on your research
- Meet deadlines and commitments
- Are available for scheduled meetings and lab events
- Communicate your schedule and availability

### Time Off

Taking time off is important for maintaining productivity and well-being. Lab members should:

- Coordinate time off with the PIs in advance
- Ensure ongoing projects are covered during your absence
- Update the lab calendar with your planned absences
- Follow university policies for holidays and leave

## Communication

### Lab Meetings

We hold regular lab meetings to discuss ongoing research, practice presentations, and discuss relevant literature. All lab members are expected to attend unless they have a conflict.

- **Frequency**: Weekly (schedule may vary by quarter)
- **Format**: Varies - research updates, journal clubs, practice talks
- **Preparation**: Come prepared to participate and provide constructive feedback

### Individual Meetings

Graduate students and postdocs should meet with their PI(s) regularly:

- **Frequency**: At least bi-weekly, more often as needed
- **Preparation**: Send an agenda at least 24 hours in advance
- **Follow-up**: Send notes summarizing action items and decisions

### Email and Messaging

- Check email regularly during working hours
- Respond to emails from PIs and collaborators within 24-48 hours
- Use subject lines that clearly indicate the topic
- For urgent matters, follow up with a message or call

### Lab Slack/Communication Platform

[If applicable] We use [platform name] for day-to-day communication:

- Use appropriate channels for different topics
- Respect people's off-hours by using scheduled messages when appropriate
- Keep communications professional but friendly

## Research Practices

### Project Management

- Maintain a clear project timeline with milestones
- Keep the PIs informed of progress and challenges
- Document your work thoroughly
- Use version control (e.g., Git) for code
- Follow reproducible research practices

### Data Management

- Follow the lab's data management plan
- Store data securely and back up regularly
- Document data sources, processing steps, and analyses
- Use clear, consistent file naming conventions
- Prepare data for archiving and sharing as appropriate

### Code and Software

- Write clear, well-commented code
- Use version control for all code
- Follow coding style guidelines (e.g., tidyverse style guide for R)
- Share code openly when publishing (e.g., via GitHub)
- Document software dependencies and versions

### Literature and Resources

- Stay current with relevant literature in your field
- Maintain a reference management system (e.g., Zotero, Mendeley)
- Share interesting papers with the lab
- Contribute to lab knowledge base

### Lab Notebooks and Documentation

- Maintain clear records of your research activities
- Document analyses, decisions, and results
- Make your work reproducible by others
- Store notebooks/documentation in accessible locations

## Authorship and Publications

### Authorship Guidelines

We follow standard academic authorship practices:

- **First authorship**: Typically goes to the person who led the work
- **Corresponding author**: Usually the PI, unless otherwise agreed
- **Co-authorship**: Determined by substantial intellectual contributions
- **Acknowledgments**: For contributions that don't meet authorship criteria

Authorship should be discussed early in a project and revisited as the work evolves.

### Publication Process

1. **Planning**: Discuss target journals and outline with PIs
2. **Drafting**: Lead author prepares initial draft
3. **Internal review**: Co-authors review and provide feedback
4. **Revision**: Lead author incorporates feedback
5. **Submission**: After PI approval
6. **Revisions**: Lead author coordinates response to reviewers

### Preprints and Open Access

We encourage posting preprints and publishing in open access journals when possible.

## Mentorship and Professional Development

### Mentoring Philosophy

We believe in individualized mentoring that supports each person's career goals. Regular communication between mentees and mentors is essential.

### Individual Development Plans

All graduate students and postdocs should maintain an Individual Development Plan (IDP) that outlines:

- Short-term and long-term career goals
- Skills to develop
- Training needs
- Timeline and milestones

Update your IDP annually and discuss with your PI.

### Presentations and Conferences

We encourage lab members to present their work at conferences:

- Discuss conference opportunities with PIs
- Submit abstracts with PI approval
- Practice presentations in lab meeting
- Funding for conferences depends on availability

### Teaching and Outreach

Teaching and outreach are valuable professional development opportunities:

- Graduate students are encouraged to gain teaching experience
- We support science communication and outreach activities
- Discuss opportunities with PIs

### Networking

Building a professional network is important for your career:

- Attend seminars and departmental events
- Connect with researchers in your field
- Join professional societies
- Use social media professionally (e.g., Twitter/X for science)

## Health, Safety, and Well-being

### Laboratory Safety

[If applicable] For lab members conducting wet lab work:

- Complete required safety training
- Follow all safety protocols
- Report any incidents or concerns
- Use appropriate personal protective equipment

### Mental Health and Well-being

Graduate school and research can be stressful. Resources available include:

- UC Davis [Counseling Services](https://shcs.ucdavis.edu/services/counseling-services)
- [Employee Assistance Program](https://hr.ucdavis.edu/departments/asap/employee/eap) for employees
- Talk to your PI if you're struggling
- Reach out to peer support networks

### Harassment and Discrimination

We are committed to providing a harassment-free environment. If you experience or witness harassment or discrimination:

- Contact your PI (if comfortable)
- Use university reporting systems
- Contact the [UC Davis Office of Compliance and Policy](https://compliance.ucdavis.edu/)

## Funding and Resources

### Funding Acknowledgments

All publications and presentations should acknowledge funding sources as required by grant agreements.

### Grant Writing

- Graduate students and postdocs are encouraged to apply for fellowships
- PIs will support fellowship applications with feedback and letters
- Start planning fellowship applications well in advance of deadlines
