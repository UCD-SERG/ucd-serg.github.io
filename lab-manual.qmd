# Welcome to the UC Davis Seroepidemiology Research Group!

## About the lab

Welcome to the UC Davis Seroepidemiology Research Group (UCD-SeRG), led by Drs. Kristen Aiemjoy and Ezra Morrison. Our mission is to improve population health by developing and applying seroepidemiologic methods to characterize infectious disease burden in populations. We focus on diseases that are under-recognized due to limited diagnostics and resource-intensive surveillance systems, including enteric fever (*Salmonella Typhi and Paratyphi*), Scrub Typhus (*Orientia tsutsugamushi*), Melioidosis (*Burkholderia pseudomallei*), Shigella (*Shigella spp.*), and Cholera (*Vibrio cholerae*). 

Our research group is based at the University of California, Davis, and we collaborate with partners around the world, including in South Asia, Southeast Asia, Sub-Saharan Africa, and Latin America. We use a variety of epidemiologic, computational, and statistical methods, including causal inference and machine learning methods, in pursuit of our mission.

## About this lab manual

This lab manual covers our communication strategy, code of conduct, and best practices for reproducibility of computational workflows. It is a living document that is updated regularly to reflect our evolving practices and lessons learned.

This manual was created with inspiration from [other scientists' lab manuals](https://github.com/jadebc/lab-manual), particularly the [Benjamin-Chung Lab Manual](https://jadebc.github.io/lab-manual/). 

Feel free to draw from this manual and adapt it for your own use.

## Mission and Values

### Our Mission

We develop and apply seroepidemiologic methods to characterize infectious disease burden in populations, with a focus on diseases that are under-recognized due to limited diagnostics and resource-intensive surveillance. Our work aims to provide accurate methods to measure infectious disease burden to guide public health decisions.

### Our Values

- **Scientific rigor and reproducibility**: We are committed to conducting high-quality, reproducible research that advances the field
- **Open science**: We share our methods, code, and data openly whenever possible to enable others to build upon our work
- **Collaboration**: We work with partners around the world and value diverse perspectives and interdisciplinary approaches
- **Mentorship**: We support the professional development of all lab members at every career stage
- **Diversity, equity, and inclusion**: We strive to create a welcoming, anti-racist environment where people of all backgrounds are equally and inclusively supported
- **Work-life balance**: We recognize that doing great science requires taking care of ourselves and maintaining sustainable work practices

## Culture and Conduct

### Lab Culture

We are committed to a lab culture that is collaborative, supportive, inclusive, open, and free from discrimination and harassment. 

We encourage lab members of all experience levels to respectfully share their honest opinions and ideas on any topic. Our group thrives upon such respectful input from team members, and open dialogue helps us continuously improve our productivity and the quality of our work.

### Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion

The UCD-SeRG lab recognizes the importance of and is committed to cultivating a culture of diversity, equity, and inclusion. This means being a safe, supportive, and anti-racist environment in which students from diverse backgrounds are equally and inclusively supported in their education and training. Diversity takes many forms, including, but not limited to, differences in race, ethnicity, gender, sexuality, socioeconomic status, religion, disability, and political affiliation.

### General Expectations

All lab members are expected to:

- Conduct research with integrity and honesty
- Treat all lab members, collaborators, and research participants with respect
- Communicate openly and regularly with the PIs and other lab members
- Contribute to a positive, collaborative lab environment
- Take responsibility for your own professional development
- Participate in lab meetings and group activities
- Maintain good documentation of your work
- Follow all institutional policies and research ethics guidelines

### Work Hours and Flexibility

We recognize that people have different working styles and personal obligations. One benefit of the academic environment is its schedule flexibility. Graduate students and postdocs are expected to work full-time hours, but we offer flexibility in when and where you work. Undergraduate researchers typically commit 10-15 hours per week.

Lab members may choose to work in the early morning, evening, or weekends. However, we do not expect lab members to respond to communications outside of business hours unless there are special circumstances.

What matters most is that you:

- Make consistent progress on your research
- Meet deadlines and commitments
- Are available for scheduled meetings and lab events
- Communicate your schedule and availability

### Time Off

Taking time off is important for maintaining productivity and well-being. Lab members should:

- Coordinate time off with the PIs in advance
- Alert the team if you will be unusually busy (e.g., taking exams, major deadlines) or on vacation so we know not to expect immediate responses
- Ensure ongoing projects are covered during your absence
- Update the lab calendar with your planned absences
- Follow university policies for holidays and leave

### Protecting Human Subjects

All lab members must complete required human subjects research training (e.g., CITI training) and share their certificate with the PIs. Team members will be added to relevant Institutional Review Board (IRB) protocols prior to working with identifiable datasets.

One of the most relevant aspects of protecting human subjects in our work is maintaining confidentiality. In practice, this means:

- Understand and comply with project-specific policies about where data can be saved, particularly if the data include personal identifiers
- Do not share data with anyone without permission, including other members of the group who might not be on the same IRB protocol (check with PIs first)
- Remember that data that appears non-identifiable may still require special protection under IRB or HIPAA regulations
- Always proceed with caution and ask for help if you have concerns about maintaining study participant confidentiality

### Authorship

We adhere to the [ICMJE Definition of authorship](http://www.icmje.org/recommendations/browse/roles-and-responsibilities/defining-the-role-of-authors-and-contributors.html) and are happy for team members who meet the definition of authorship to be included as co-authors on scientific manuscripts.

Authorship should be discussed early in a project and revisited as the work evolves to ensure transparency and fairness.

## Communication and Coordination

Effective communication is essential for successful collaboration. We use several platforms for different types of communication.

### Slack (or Primary Communication Platform)

- Use Slack for scheduling, coding-related questions, quick check-ins, and day-to-day coordination
- If your message exceeds 200 words, consider using email instead
- Use channels instead of direct messages unless discussing something private
- Please respond to messages that tag you (e.g., `@yourname`) as quickly as possible and always within 24 hours
- If you are unusually busy or on vacation, alert the team in advance and set your status so we know not to expect immediate responses
- Thread messages as much as possible to keep conversations organized
- Respect people's off-hours by using scheduled messages when appropriate

### Email

- Use email for longer messages (>200 words) or messages that merit preservation
- Generally, strive to respond within 24 hours during business hours
- As noted above, if you are unusually busy or on vacation, alert the team in advance

### Project Management Tools

- We use project management tools (e.g., Trello, GitHub Projects) to track tasks and progress
- Higher priority tasks are listed at the top of your list
- Strive to complete tasks by the dates listed
- Use checklists to break down tasks into smaller, manageable chunks
- Update task status regularly to keep the team informed

### Lab Meetings

We hold regular lab meetings to discuss ongoing research, practice presentations, and discuss relevant literature. All lab members are expected to attend unless they have a conflict.

- **Timing**: Meetings start on time. If you will be late, send a message to the group
- **Frequency**: Weekly (schedule may vary by quarter)
- **Format**: Varies - research updates, journal clubs, practice talks, methods discussions
- **Preparation**: Come prepared to participate and provide constructive feedback
- If you are regularly unable to attend at the scheduled time, notify the team so we can consider adjusting the schedule

### Individual Meetings

Graduate students and postdocs should meet with their PI(s) regularly:

- **Frequency**: At least bi-weekly, more often as needed
- **Preparation**: Send an agenda at least 24 hours in advance
- **Follow-up**: Send notes summarizing action items and decisions

### Email and Messaging

- Check email regularly during working hours
- Respond to emails from PIs and collaborators within 24-48 hours
- Use subject lines that clearly indicate the topic
- For urgent matters, follow up with a message or call
- We do not expect responses outside of business hours

## Research Practices and Reproducibility

### Commitment to Reproducibility

Our lab adopts rigorous practices to maximize the reproducibility of our work:

1. Design studies with appropriate methodology and adherence to best practices in epidemiology and biostatistics
2. Register study protocols when appropriate
3. Write and register pre-analysis plans for confirmatory research
4. Create reproducible computational workflows
5. Process and analyze data with internal replication and masking when possible
6. Use reporting checklists with manuscripts
7. Publish preprints
8. Publish data (when possible) and replication code

### Why Reproducibility Matters

In the past decade, an increasing number of studies have found that published findings could not be reproduced, both computationally (with the same data and code) and scientifically (with newly collected data using similar study designs). This "reproducibility crisis" has occurred across disciplines and has motivated new practices in transparency and openness. Our lab is committed to adopting these best practices.

### Pre-Analysis Plans

We write pre-analysis plans for most original research projects that are confirmatory in nature. Pre-analysis plans typically include:

1. Brief background and rationale
2. Hypotheses / objectives
3. Study design
4. Description of data and data sources
5. Definition of outcomes
6. Definition of interventions / exposures
7. Definition of covariates
8. Statistical power calculation
9. Statistical analysis plan:
   - Type of model
   - Covariate selection / screening
   - Standard error estimation method
   - Missing data analysis
   - Assessment of effect modification / subgroup analyses
   - Sensitivity analyses
   - Negative control analyses (when applicable)

We typically register pre-analysis plans on platforms like Open Science Framework ([osf.io](https://osf.io)).

### Project Management

- Maintain a clear project timeline with milestones
- Keep the PIs informed of progress and challenges
- Document your work thoroughly

## Authorship and Publications

### Authorship Guidelines

We follow the [ICMJE Definition of authorship](http://www.icmje.org/recommendations/browse/roles-and-responsibilities/defining-the-role-of-authors-and-contributors.html). To qualify for authorship, individuals must meet all four criteria:

1. Substantial contributions to conception/design, or acquisition/analysis/interpretation of data
2. Drafting the work or revising it critically for important intellectual content
3. Final approval of the version to be published
4. Agreement to be accountable for all aspects of the work

**Authorship practices:**

- **First authorship**: Typically goes to the person who led the work
- **Corresponding author**: Usually the PI, unless otherwise agreed
- **Co-authorship**: Determined by substantial intellectual contributions
- **Author order**: Should be discussed and agreed upon by all authors
- **Acknowledgments**: For contributions that don't meet authorship criteria

Authorship should be discussed early in a project and revisited as the work evolves. We encourage using the [CRediT Taxonomy](https://credit.niso.org/) to document specific author contributions.

### Publication Process

1. **Planning**: Discuss target journals, outline, and timeline with PIs
2. **Drafting**: Lead author prepares initial draft
3. **Internal review**: Co-authors review and provide feedback
4. **Revision**: Lead author incorporates feedback iteratively
5. **PI approval**: Obtain final approval from PIs before submission
6. **Submission**: Submit to journal
7. **Revisions**: Lead author coordinates response to peer reviewers
8. **Publication**: Celebrate and share!

### Preprints and Open Access

- We encourage posting preprints prior to or during peer review on platforms like [medRxiv](https://www.medrxiv.org/) or [bioRxiv](https://www.biorxiv.org/)
- Preprints allow rapid dissemination of findings and can be cited in grant applications
- We support publishing in open access journals when possible to maximize accessibility
- Many funders, including NIH, have public access policies that require making publications freely available

### Reporting Checklists

Using reporting checklists ensures that publications contain information needed for readers to assess validity and reproducibility. We use checklists appropriate to study design:

- CONSORT for randomized trials
- STROBE for observational studies
- PRISMA for systematic reviews
- Others as appropriate (see [EQUATOR Network](https://www.equator-network.org/))

### Publishing Data and Code

- We publish data on platforms like [Open Science Framework](https://osf.io) when ethically and legally permissible
- We share analysis code via GitHub repositories
- We archive code on [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org) for long-term preservation with DOI
- Include data dictionaries and README files with published datasets
- Follow funder and journal requirements for data sharing
